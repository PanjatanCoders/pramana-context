# Pramana Context

**Remember why you opened it.**

Pramana Context is a browser extension that captures the *intent* behind every tab, link, and page you open — so you never lose context in long-running work.

Modern browsing is optimized for speed, not memory. Pramana Context fixes that by acting as a lightweight cognitive layer for your browser.

## 🧠 What Problem Does It Solve?

People don’t forget links.
They forget *why* those links mattered.

- Tabs stay open for days with no context
- Bookmarks lose meaning over time
- Research, debugging, and learning get fragmented
- Important work is silently abandoned

Pramana Context preserves intent so you can resume work without mental reload.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- Capture the purpose behind a tab or page
- Search by intent, not URL or title
- Track revisits and unresolved work
- Group related browsing automatically
- Keep all data local and private

No task lists. No forced workflows.  
Just memory, where it matters.

## 🧩 How It Works (High Level)

1. You open a page or keep a tab active
2. Pramana Context captures page metadata
3. You optionally add a one-line intent
4. The extension stores and links context over time
5. You recall work instantly by *meaning*, not mechanics

## 🔐 Privacy First

- No cloud sync by default
- All data stored locally in the browser
- No tracking, no analytics, no ads
- AI-based features (future) will be opt-in only

Your context is yours.

*Pramana* means “valid knowledge” or “means of knowing.”

Pramana Context exists to preserve not just information — but understanding.
